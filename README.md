# Deploy, Manage and Query Cloud Infrastructure using SQL

[[Documentation](https://docs.stackql.io/)]  [[Developer Guide](/docs/developer_guide.md)] [[BYO Providers](/docs/registry_contribution.md)]

## Cloud infrastructure coding using SQL

> StackQL allows you to create, modify and query the state of services and resources across all three major public cloud providers (Google, AWS and Azure) using a common, widely known DSL...SQL.

----
## Its as easy as...
    SELECT * FROM google.compute.instances WHERE zone = 'australia-southeast1-b' AND project = 'my-project' ;

----

```
select d1.name, d1.id, d2.name as d2_name, d2.status, d2.label, d2.id as d2_id from google.compute.disks d1 inner join okta.application.apps d2 on d1.name = d2.label where d1.project = 'lab-kr-network-01' and d1.zone = 'australia-southeast1-a' and d2.subdomain = 'dev-79923018-admin';
```

## Provider development

Keen to expose some new functionality though `stackql`?  We are very keen on this!  

Please see [registry_contribution.md](/docs/registry_contribution.md).

## Providers

Please see [the stackql-provider-registry repository](https://github.com/stackql/stackql-provider-registry)

Providers include:

- Google.
- Okta.
- ...

## Build

Presuming you have all of [the system requirements](#system-requirements-for-local-devlopment-build-and-test), then build/test with cmake:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Executable `build/stackql` will be created.

### System requirements for local development, build and test

- cmake>=3.22.3
- golang>=1.16
- openssl>=1.1.1
- python>=3.5


## Run

```bash
./build/stackql --help

```

## Examples

```
./stackql exec "show extended services from google where title = 'Service Directory API';"
```

More examples in [docs/examples.md](/docs/examples.md).
