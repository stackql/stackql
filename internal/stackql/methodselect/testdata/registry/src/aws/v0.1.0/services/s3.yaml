        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        This implementation of the `GET` action uses the `acl` subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use `GET` to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have the `READ_ACP` access to the bucket. If `READ_ACP` permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

        When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

        When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

        If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see [ Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

      description: "End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued\
        \ support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to\
        \ use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request\
        \ will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects\
        \ the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West\
        \ (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific\
        \ (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São\
        \ Paulo).\n\nThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.\n\nSets\
        \ the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL).\
        \ For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html).\
        \ To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission.\n\n\
        You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:\n\
        \n  * Specify the ACL in the request body\n\n  * Specify permissions using\
        \ request headers\n\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body\
        \ and the request headers.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you may\
        \ choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers.\
        \ For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL\
        \ using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.\n\n\
        If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership,\
        \ ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies\
        \ to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs\
        \ or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error\
        \ code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see\
        \ [Controlling object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\nYou can set access\
        \ permissions by using one of the following methods:\n\n  * Specify a canned\
        \ ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined\
        \ ACLs, known as _canned ACLs_. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees\
        \ and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-acl`.\
        \ If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers\
        \ in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).\n\
        \n  * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,\
        \ `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using\
        \ these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon\
        \ Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission.\
        \ If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the `x-amz-acl` header\
        \ to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that\
        \ Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control\
        \ List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).\n\
        \nYou specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of\
        \ the following:\n\n    * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user\
        \ ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\n    * `uri` – if you are granting\
        \ permissions to a predefined group\n\n    * `emailAddress` – if the value\
        \ specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nUsing\
        \ email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following\
        \ Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\n      * US East (N. Virginia)\n\n      *\
        \ US West (N. California)\n\n      * US West (Oregon)\n\n      * Asia Pacific\
        \ (Singapore)\n\n      * Asia Pacific (Sydney)\n\n      * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\
        \n      * Europe (Ireland)\n\n      * South America (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list\
        \ of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)\
        \ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nFor example, the following\
        \ `x-amz-grant-write` header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects\
        \ permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web\
        \ Services accounts identified by their email addresses.\n\n`x-amz-grant-write:\
        \ uri=\"http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery\", id=\"111122223333\"\
        , id=\"555566667777\" `\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access\
        \ permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nGrantee Values\n\n    \n\n\
        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights\
        \ (using request elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify\
        \ these grantee values in JSON format, see the Amazon Web Services CLI example\
        \ in [ Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * By the person's ID:\n\n`<>ID<><>GranteesEmail<>\
        \ `\n\nDisplayName is optional and ignored in the request\n\n  * By URI:\n\
        \n`<>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<>`\n\n  * By\
        \ Email address:\n\n`<>Grantees@email.com<>&`\n\nThe grantee is resolved to\
        \ the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears\
        \ as the CanonicalUser.\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only\
        \ supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\n    * US East\
        \ (N. Virginia)\n\n    * US West (N. California)\n\n    * US West (Oregon)\n\
        \n    * Asia Pacific (Singapore)\n\n    * Asia Pacific (Sydney)\n\n    * Asia\
        \ Pacific (Tokyo)\n\n    * Europe (Ireland)\n\n    * South America (São Paulo)\n\
        \nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions\
        \ and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)\
        \ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nThe following operations\
        \ are related to `PutBucketAcl`:\n\n  * [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)\n\

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket

            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            \nAmazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to\
            \ an S3 bucket. When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption\
            \ information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target\
            \ object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination\
            \ bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration\
            \ that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\
            \ If the destination bucket has a different default encryption configuration,\
            \ Amazon S3 uses the corresponding encryption key to encrypt the target\
            \ object copy.\n\nWith server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your\
            \ data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts\
            \ the data when you access it. For more information about server-side\
            \ encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html)\
            \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**General purpose buckets**\n\n  *\
            \ For general purpose buckets, there are the following supported options\
            \ for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Key Management\
            \ Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with\
            \ Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), and server-side encryption\
            \ with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 uses the corresponding\
            \ KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.\n\
            \n  * When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a\
            \ different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can\
            \ specify appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target\
            \ object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided\
            \ key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the\
            \ default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption\
            \ setting in your request takes precedence. \n\n**Directory buckets**\n\
            \n  * For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for\
            \ server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed\
            \ keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS)\
            \ (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses\
            \ the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket\
            \ default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object\
            \ requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired\
            \ encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with\
            \ server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\

            \n  * To encrypt new object copies to a directory bucket with SSE-KMS,\
            \ we recommend you specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption\
            \ configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)).\

            \ 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)\
            \ per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify\
            \ a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer\
            \ managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration. Then, when you perform\
            \ a `CopyObject` operation and want to specify server-side encryption\
            \ settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS in the encryption-related\
            \ request headers, you must ensure the encryption key is the same customer\
            \ managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption\
            \ configuration. \n\n  * **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** \\- When\
            \ accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points,\
            \ the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon\
            \ FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted\
            \ at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the\
            \ file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes\

            **Directory buckets** \- To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it''s recommended

            the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses
            the bucket''s default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly
            set the ` x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must
            match the bucket''s default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN,
            not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed
            key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)

            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)

            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,

            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            **Object Lambda access points** \- When you use this action with an Object
            Lambda access point, you must direct requests to the Object Lambda access
            point hostname. The Object Lambda access point hostname takes the form
            _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-object-lambda._Region_.amazonaws.com.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Object Lambda access points** \- When you use this API operation with
            an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda
            access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access
            point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`
            is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`,
            see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            \ When you request an object (`GetObject`) or object metadata (`HeadObject`)\
            \ from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the `x-amz-replication-status`\
            \ header in the response as follows:\n\n  * **If requesting an object\
            \ from the source bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the `x-amz-replication-status`\
            \ header if the object in your request is eligible for replication.\n\n\
            For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify\
            \ object prefix `TaxDocs` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with\
            \ key prefix `TaxDocs`. Any objects you upload with this key name prefix,\
            \ for example `TaxDocs/document1.pdf`, are eligible for replication. For\
            \ any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return\
            \ the `x-amz-replication-status` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED\
            \ or FAILED indicating object replication status.\n\n  * **If requesting\
            \ an object from a destination bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the `x-amz-replication-status`\
            \ header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica\
            \ that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication\
            \ in progress.\n\n  * **When replicating objects to multiple destination\
            \ buckets** , the `x-amz-replication-status` header acts differently.\
            \ The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED\
            \ when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will\
            \ remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations.\
            \ If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return\
            \ FAILED. \n\nFor more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).\n\

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            \ buckets** \\- You have four mutually exclusive options to protect data\
            \ using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose\
            \ to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options\
            \ are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS\
            \ or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts\
            \ data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)\
            \ by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest\
            \ by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information,\
            \ see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)\
            \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- For\
            \ directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side\
            \ encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)\
            \ (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).\
            \ We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption\
            \ configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in\
            \ your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects\
            \ are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For\
            \ more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\

            \ \n\nIn the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
            \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html))\
            \ using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption\
            \ settings that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You can't\
            \ override the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`,\
            \ `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`,\
            \ and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) that are specified\
            \ in the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify\
            \ these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon\
            \ S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession`\
            \ request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.\n\nWhen you\
            \ use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the\
            \ session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions\
            \ when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use\
            \ the bucket's default encryption configuration for the `CreateSession`\
            \ request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values\
            \ in the `CreateSession` request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except\
            \ [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
            \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)),\
            \ the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration\
            \ of the directory bucket.\n\n  * **S3 access points for Amazon FSx**\
            \ \\- When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access\
            \ points, the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All\
            \ Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are\
            \ encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written\
            \ to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These\

            **General purpose buckets** \- If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption`
            with `aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID (Key ID,

            or `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,
            Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) to protect
            the data.


            **Directory buckets** \- To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it''s recommended
            to specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then,
            the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses
            the bucket''s default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly

            match the bucket''s default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN,

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn''t supported
            when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web Services Local
            Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon
            Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error
            with the error code `InvalidRequest`.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            \ the source object through an [access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):\n\
            \n  * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name\
            \ of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash\
            \ (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from the\
            \ bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\n  * For objects accessed through access\
            \ points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed\
            \ through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/`.\
            \ For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access\
            \ point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`,\
            \ use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL encoded.\n\n    * Amazon S3 supports copy operations\
            \ using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are\
            \ in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\n    * Access points are not\
            \ supported by directory buckets.\n\nAlternatively, for objects accessed\
            \ through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed\
            \ in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/`. For example,\
            \ to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost`\
            \ owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding\
            \ of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\nIf your bucket has versioning enabled,\
            \ you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source`\
            \ identifies the current version of the source object to copy. To copy\
            \ a specific version of the source object to copy, append `?versionId=`\
            \ to the `x-amz-copy-source` request header (for example, `x-amz-copy-source:\
            \ /awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).\n\
            \nIf the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId\
            \ in the `x-amz-copy-source` request header, Amazon S3 returns a `404\
            \ Not Found` error, because the object does not exist. If you specify\
            \ versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` and the versionId is a delete marker,\
            \ Amazon S3 returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error, because you are not\

            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names

            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
