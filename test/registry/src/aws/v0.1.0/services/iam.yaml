      description: <p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP)
        that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p>
        <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a
        principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship
        between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.</p> <p>If you are using
        an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't
        need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers
        are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use.
        Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider.
        To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html">Creating
        a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM User
        Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p>The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust</p> </li>
        <li> <p>A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application
        or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider</p> </li>
        <li> <p>A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the
        IdP uses</p> </li> </ul> <p>You get all of this information from the OIDC
        IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web
        Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through
        our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate
        thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include
        Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set
        (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration,
        but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>The trust for
        the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates.
        Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a>
        operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>

          of only a hostname, like <code>https://server.example.org</code> or <code>https://example.com</code>.
          The URL should not contain a port number. </p> <p>You cannot register the

          OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity
          provider is rotating certificates.</p> <p>The server certificate thumbprint
          is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the

          always a 40-character string.</p> <p>You must provide at least one thumbprint
          when creating an IAM OIDC provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider
          is <code>server.example.com</code> and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect.
          In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash

      description: <p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP)
        that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p>
        <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a
        principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship
        between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.</p> <p>If you are using
        an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't
        need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers
        are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use.
        Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider.
        To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html">Creating
        a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM User
        Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p>The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust</p> </li>
        <li> <p>A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application
        or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider</p> </li>
        <li> <p>A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the
        IdP uses</p> </li> </ul> <p>You get all of this information from the OIDC
        IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web
        Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through
        our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate
        thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include
        Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set
        (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration,
        but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>The trust for
        the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates.
        Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a>
        operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>

        Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to
        assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single
        sign-on (SSO) to the Amazon Web Services Management Console or one that supports
        API access to Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>When you create the SAML provider
        resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP.
        That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys
        that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions)
        that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity

      description: <p>Deletes the specified managed policy.</p> <p>Before you can
        delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users,
        groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all
        the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting
        a managed policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Detach the policy from all users, groups,
        and roles that the policy is attached to, using <a>DetachUserPolicy</a>, <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>,
        or <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. To list all the users, groups, and roles that
        a policy is attached to, use <a>ListEntitiesForPolicy</a>.</p> </li> <li>
        <p>Delete all versions of the policy using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a>. To
        list the policy's versions, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>. You cannot use
        <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> to delete the version that is marked as the default
        version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process.</p>
        </li> <li> <p>Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default
        version) using this operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about managed
        policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed
        policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

        valid only in Amazon Web Services Regions that are available by default. These
        tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong

        policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate
        resources that don't exist in your account.</p> <p>You can optionally include
        a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include
        in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings,
        use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>You can also optionally include
        one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included
        in the simulation.</p> <p>The simulation does not perform the API operations;
        it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow
        or deny the operations.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> This operation discloses information
        about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to
        see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a>
        instead.</p> <p>Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services
        and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request.
        You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate
        context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for
        correct simulation, use <a>GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy</a>.</p> <p>If
        the output is long, you can use the <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code>
        parameters to paginate the results.</p> <p>For more information about using
        the policy simulator, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html">Testing
        IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator </a>in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

      description: <p>Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with
        the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use
        certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private
        key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is <code>Active</code>.</p>
        <p>For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Managing
        server certificates in IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If the
        <code>UserName</code> is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly
        based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This
        operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently,
        you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user
        credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.</p>
        <note> <p>Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should
        use POST rather than GET when calling <code>UploadSigningCertificate</code>.
