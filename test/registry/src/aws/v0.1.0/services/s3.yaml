      description: "This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload\
        \ is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The\
        \ storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However,\
        \ if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might\
        \ or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given\
        \ multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage\
        \ consumed by all parts.\n\nTo verify that all parts have been removed and\
        \ prevent getting charged for the part storage, you should call the [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)\
        \ API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.\n\n  * **Directory\
        \ buckets** \\- If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress,\
        \ you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads\
        \ are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads,\
        \ use the `ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress multipart\
        \ uploads in the bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort\
        \ all the in-progress multipart uploads. \n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\\
        - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to\
        \ the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests\

        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\

      operationId: CompleteMultipartUpload
      description: "Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded\
        \ parts.\n\nYou first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts\
        \ using the [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\
        \ operation or the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)\
        \ operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload,\
        \ you call this `CompleteMultipartUpload` operation to complete the upload.\
        \ Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending\
        \ order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload\
        \ request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list\
        \ is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the\
        \ parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must\
        \ provide the `PartNumber` value and the `ETag` value that are returned after\
        \ that part was uploaded.\n\nThe processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request\
        \ could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing\
        \ the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a `200 OK`\
        \ response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends\
        \ white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request\
        \ could fail after the initial `200 OK` response has been sent. This means\
        \ that a `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error. The error\
        \ response might be embedded in the `200 OK` response. If you call this API\
        \ operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents\
        \ of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services\
        \ SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and\
        \ apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically\
        \ retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs\
        \ throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return\
        \ an error).\n\nNote that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications\
        \ should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses).\
        \ For more information, see [Amazon S3 Error Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html).\n\
        \nYou can't use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the\
        \ CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a `Content-Type`\
        \ header, `CompleteMultipartUpload` can still return a `200 OK` response.\n\

        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nIf you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted\
        \ with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS),\
        \ you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions\
        \ in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve\
        \ the checksum of the object.\n\nEncryption\n\n    \n\nEncryption request\
        \ headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD`\
        \ requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management\
        \ Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon\
        \ Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon\
        \ S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption`\
        \ header is used when you `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption\
        \ method. If you include this header in a `HEAD` request for an object that\
        \ uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's\
        \ because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\
        \nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided\
        \ encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when\
        \ you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers\
        \ to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the\
        \ object's metadata. The headers are:\n\n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n\
        \n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n\n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\
        \nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided\
        \ Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory bucket** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption:\
        \ SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting\
        \ data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nVersioning\n\n    \n\n  * If the current\
        \ version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object\
        \ was deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.\n\n\
        \  * If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405\
        \ Method Not Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.\n\
        \n  * **Directory buckets** \\- Delete marker is not supported for directory\
        \ buckets.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- S3 Versioning isn't enabled and\
        \ supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null`\
        \ value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only\
        \ specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nHTTP\
        \ Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\- The HTTP Host header\
        \ syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nFor directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to\
        \ the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests\
        \ in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nThe following actions are related to `HeadObject`:\n\
        \n  * [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)\n\
        \nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,\
        \ if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`,\
        \ you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

      description: "Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.\n\
        \nEnd of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued\
        \ support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to\
        \ use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request\
        \ will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects\
        \ the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West\
        \ (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific\
        \ (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São\
        \ Paulo).\n\nYou can store individual objects of up to 50 TB in Amazon S3.\
        \ You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action\
        \ using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use\
        \ the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information,\
        \ see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html).\n\
        \nYou can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between\
        \ directory buckets, and between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.\n\
        \n  * Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points\
        \ only as a destination when using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN. \n\n\
        \  * **Directory buckets** \\- For directory buckets, you must make requests\
        \ for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style\
        \ requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\

        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region\
        \ requests (including copies). If you're using VPC endpoints, your source\
        \ and destination buckets should be in the same Amazon Web Services Region\
        \ as your VPC endpoint.\n\nBoth the Region that you want to copy the object\
        \ from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled\
        \ for your account. For more information about how to enable a Region for\
        \ your account, see [Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone)\
        \ in the _Amazon Web Services Account Management Guide_.\n\nAmazon S3 transfer\
        \ acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region\
        \ copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a `400 Bad Request`\
        \ error. For more information, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html).\n\
        \nAuthentication and authorization\n\n    \n\nAll `CopyObject` requests must\
        \ be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and\
        \ secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the `x-amz-`\
        \ prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be signed. For more information,\
        \ see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html).\n\
        \n**Directory buckets** \\- You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate\
        \ and authorize your access to the `CopyObject` API operation, instead of\
        \ using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API\
        \ operation.\n\nAmazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and\
        \ authorization on your behalf.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\nYou must have _read_\
        \ access to the source object and _write_ access to the destination bucket.\n\
        \n  * **General purpose bucket permissions** \\- You must have permissions\
        \ in an IAM policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a `CopyObject`\
        \ operation.\n\n    * If the source object is in a general purpose bucket,\
        \ you must have **`s3:GetObject` ** permission to read the source object that\
        \ is being copied. \n\n    * If the destination bucket is a general purpose\
        \ bucket, you must have **`s3:PutObject` ** permission to write the object\
        \ copy to the destination bucket. \n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions**\
        \ \\- You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based\
        \ policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a `CopyObject`\
        \ operation.\n\n    * If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory\
        \ bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession` ** permission in the\
        \ `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session\
        \ is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can\
        \ explicitly set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on\
        \ the copy source bucket.\n\n    * If the copy destination is a directory\
        \ bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession` ** permission in the\
        \ `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The\
        \ `s3express:SessionMode` condition key can't be set to `ReadOnly` on the\
        \ copy destination bucket. \n\nIf the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you\
        \ must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in\
        \ IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nFor\
        \ example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html)\
        \ and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based\
        \ policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nResponse and special errors\n\n    \n\n\
        When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When\
        \ the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the\
        \ `Content-Length`. You always need to read the entire response body to check\
        \ if the copy succeeds.\n\n  * If the copy is successful, you receive a response\
        \ with information about the copied object.\n\n  * A copy request might return\
        \ an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is\
        \ copying the files. A `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an\
        \ error.\n\n    * If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive\
        \ a standard Amazon S3 error.\n\n    * If the error occurs during the copy\
        \ operation, the error response is embedded in the `200 OK` response. For\
        \ example, in a cross-region copy, you may encounter throttling and receive\
        \ a `200 OK` response. For more information, see [Resolve the Error 200 response\
        \ when copying objects to Amazon S3](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-resolve-200-internalerror).\
        \ The `200 OK` status code means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean\
        \ the copy is complete. Another example is when you disconnect from Amazon\
        \ S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you\
        \ may receive a `200 OK` response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until\
        \ the entire response is successfully received and processed.\n\nIf you call\
        \ this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse\
        \ the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon\
        \ Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded\
        \ error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including\
        \ automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists,\
        \ the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions,\
        \ they return an error).\n\nCharge\n\n    \n\nThe copy request charge is based\
        \ on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object.\
        \ The request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if\
        \ the source storage class bills for data retrieval. If the copy source is\
        \ in a different region, the data transfer is billed to the copy source account.\
        \ For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\n\
        \nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- The HTTP\
        \ Host header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \n  * **Amazon S3 on Outposts** \\- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts\
        \ through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.\
        \ The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.\
        \ The hostname isn't required when you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or\
        \ SDKs.\n\nThe following operations are related to `CopyObject`:\n\n  * [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\
        \nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,\
        \ if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`,\
        \ you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

      operationId: CreateBucket
      description: "This action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3\
        \ on Outposts bucket, see [ `CreateBucket` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html).\n\
        \nCreates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and\
        \ have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests.\
        \ Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the\
        \ bucket, you become the bucket owner.\n\nThere are two types of buckets:\
        \ general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about\
        \ these bucket types, see [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon\
        \ S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **General purpose buckets** \\- If\
        \ you send your `CreateBucket` request to the `s3.amazonaws.com` global endpoint,\
        \ the request goes to the `us-east-1` Region. So the signature calculations\
        \ in Signature Version 4 must use `us-east-1` as the Region, even if the location\
        \ constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to\
        \ be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia),\
        \ your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information,\
        \ see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint.\
        \ These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_bucket-name_\
        \ `. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information\
        \ about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints\
        \ for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket permissions** \\- In addition to the `s3:CreateBucket` permission,\
        \ the following permissions are required in a policy when your `CreateBucket`\
        \ request includes specific headers: \n\n    * **Access control lists (ACLs)**\
        \ \\- In your `CreateBucket` request, if you specify an access control list\
        \ (ACL) and set it to `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`,\
        \ or if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both `s3:CreateBucket`\
        \ and `s3:PutBucketAcl` permissions are required. In your `CreateBucket` request,\
        \ if you set the ACL to `private`, or if you don't specify any ACLs, only\
        \ the `s3:CreateBucket` permission is required. \n\n    * **Object Lock**\
        \ \\- In your `CreateBucket` request, if you set `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled`\
        \ to true, the `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` and `s3:PutBucketVersioning`\
        \ permissions are required.\n\n    * **S3 Object Ownership** \\- If your `CreateBucket`\
        \ request includes the `x-amz-object-ownership` header, then the `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls`\
        \ permission is required.\n\nTo set an ACL on a bucket as part of a `CreateBucket`\
        \ request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership for the bucket to a\
        \ different value than the default, `BucketOwnerEnforced`. Additionally, if\
        \ your desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the\
        \ bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block Public\
        \ Access on the bucket before using `PutBucketAcl` to set the ACL. If you\
        \ try to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.\n\nFor\
        \ the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block\
        \ Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like\
        \ to share data with users outside of your account, you can use bucket policies\
        \ as needed. For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and\
        \ disabling ACLs for your bucket ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html)\
        \ and [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n    * **S3 Block Public Access** \\- If\
        \ your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources,\
        \ you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new\
        \ bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the [ `DeletePublicAccessBlock`\
        \ ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeletePublicAccessBlock.html)\
        \ API. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`\
        \ permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see [Blocking\
        \ public access to your Amazon S3 storage ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. \n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions**\
        \ \\- You must have the `s3express:CreateBucket` permission in an IAM identity-based\
        \ policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation\
        \ isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web\
        \ Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory\
        \ bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access\
        \ Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nThe permissions for ACLs, Object Lock,\
        \ S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for directory\
        \ buckets. For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled\
        \ at the bucket level and S3 Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced\
        \ (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.\n\nFor more information\
        \ about permissions for creating and working with directory buckets, see [Directory\
        \ buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about supported S3 features\
        \ for directory buckets, see [Features of S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-one-zone.html#s3-express-features)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory\
        \ buckets** \\- The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nThe following operations are related to `CreateBucket`:\n\n  * [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)\n\

        \ (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São\
        \ Paulo).\n\nThis action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload\
        \ ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific\
        \ multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent\
        \ upload part requests (see [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)).\
        \ You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nRequest signing\n\n    \n\nFor request\
        \ signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate\
        \ a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then\
        \ complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually.\
        \ There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more\
        \ information about signing, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services\
        \ Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket permissions** \\- To perform a multipart upload with encryption using\
        \ an Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key, the requester must have permission\
        \ to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester\
        \ must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the\
        \ `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the\
        \ `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs. These\
        \ permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from\
        \ the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more\
        \ information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions)\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\\
        - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend\
        \ that you use the [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nEncryption\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose buckets** \\- Server-side encryption\
        \ is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes\
        \ it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon\
        \ S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket.\
        \ When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information\
        \ in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to\
        \ the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,\
        \ all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side\
        \ encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket\
        \ has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption\
        \ with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided\
        \ encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided\
        \ key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload\
        \ operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for\
        \ the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with\
        \ a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key,\
        \ or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request\
        \ is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination\
        \ bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you\
        \ choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide\
        \ in [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\
        \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)\
        \ requests must match the headers you used in the `CreateMultipartUpload`\
        \ request.\n\n    * Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services\
        \ managed key (`aws/s3`) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management\
        \ Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used\
        \ to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.\n\n     \
        \ * `x-amz-server-side-encryption`\n\n      * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`\n\
        \n      * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`\n\n      * If you specify\
        \ `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,\
        \ Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3` key) in KMS\
        \ to protect the data.\n\n      * To perform a multipart upload with encryption\
        \ by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission\
        \ to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These\
        \ permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from\
        \ the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more\
        \ information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions)\
        \ and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services\
        \ KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n      * If your Identity and Access Management\
        \ (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS\
        \ key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM\
        \ user or role is in a different account from the key, then you must have\
        \ the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.\n\n  \
        \    * All `GET` and `PUT` requests for an object protected by KMS fail if\
        \ you don't make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer\
        \ Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4. For information about configuring\
        \ any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web\
        \ Services CLI, see [Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version)\

        \ Encryption with KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n    * Use customer-provided encryption\
        \ keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all\
        \ the following headers in the request.\n\n      * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n\
        \n      * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n\n      * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption:\
        \ server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and\
        \ server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend\
        \ that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration\
        \ and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession`\
        \ requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted\
        \ with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting\
        \ data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about the encryption\
        \ overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption\
        \ with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n\
        \nIn the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
        \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html))\
        \ using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption\
        \ settings that are specified in the `CreateSession` request. You can't override\
        \ the values of the encryption settings (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,\
        \ `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`)\

        \ specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and\

        \ the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration\
        \ of the directory bucket.\n\nFor directory buckets, when you perform a `CreateMultipartUpload`\
        \ operation and an `UploadPartCopy` operation, the request headers you provide\

      operationId: CreateSession
      description: "Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials\
        \ to support fast authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint\
        \ API operations on directory buckets. For more information about Zonal endpoint\
        \ API operations that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint,\
        \ see [S3 Express One Zone APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-APIs.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nTo make Zonal endpoint API requests on\
        \ a directory bucket, use the `CreateSession` API operation. Specifically,\
        \ you grant `s3express:CreateSession` permission to a bucket in a bucket policy\
        \ or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the\
        \ `CreateSession` API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security\
        \ credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token,\
        \ and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access\
        \ the Zonal endpoint API operations. After the session is created, you don’t\
        \ need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API\
        \ individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your\
        \ requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to\
        \ the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication.\
        \ You also apply the session token to the `x-amz-s3session-token` request\
        \ header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the\
        \ bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls\
        \ that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials\
        \ again to make a `CreateSession` API request that generates a new set of\
        \ temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended\
        \ or refreshed beyond the original specified interval.\n\nIf you use Amazon\
        \ Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically\
        \ to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that\
        \ you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to\
        \ the CreateSession API. For more information, see [Performance guidelines\
        \ and design patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-optimizing-performance-guidelines-design-patterns.html#s3-express-optimizing-performance-session-authentication)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * You must make requests for this API\
        \ operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style\
        \ requests in the format `https://_bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\
        \ Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **`CopyObject` API operation** \\\
        - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the `CopyObject` API operation\
        \ doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the `CreateSession`\
        \ API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about\
        \ authentication and authorization of the `CopyObject` API operation on directory\
        \ buckets, see [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html).\n\
        \n  * **`HeadBucket` API operation** \\- Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations,\
        \ the `HeadBucket` API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials\
        \ returned from the `CreateSession` API operation for authentication and authorization.\
        \ For information about authentication and authorization of the `HeadBucket`\
        \ API operation on directory buckets, see [HeadBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html).\n\
        \nPermissions\n\n    \n\nTo obtain temporary security credentials, you must\
        \ create a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants `s3express:CreateSession`\
        \ permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the `s3express:SessionMode`\
        \ condition key to control who can create a `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` session.\
        \ For more information about `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` sessions, see [ `x-amz-create-session-mode`\
        \ ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html#API_CreateSession_RequestParameters).\
        \ For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html)\
        \ and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based\
        \ policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nTo grant cross-account access to Zonal\
        \ endpoint API operations, the bucket policy should also grant both accounts\
        \ the `s3express:CreateSession` permission.\n\nIf you want to encrypt objects\
        \ with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and the `kms:Decrypt`\
        \ permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the\
        \ target KMS key.\n\nEncryption\n\n    \n\nFor directory buckets, there are\
        \ only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption\
        \ with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption\
        \ with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default\
        \ encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override\
        \ the bucket default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT`\
        \ object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the\
        \ desired encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data\
        \ with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about the encryption\
        \ overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption\
        \ with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n\
        \nFor [Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-differences.html#s3-express-differences-api-operations)\
        \ except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
        \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html),\
        \ you authenticate and authorize requests through [CreateSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ for low latency. To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS,\
        \ you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration\
        \ with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)).\
        \ Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects\
        \ are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys\
        \ during the session.\n\nOnly 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)\
        \ is supported per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The [Amazon\
        \ Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk)\
        \ (`aws/s3`) isn't supported. After you specify SSE-KMS as your bucket's default\
        \ encryption configuration with a customer managed key, you can't change the\
        \ customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.\n\nIn the Zonal\
        \ endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
        \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html))\
        \ using the REST API, you can't override the values of the encryption settings\
        \ (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,\
        \ `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`)\
        \ from the `CreateSession` request. You don't need to explicitly specify these\
        \ encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will\
        \ use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect\
        \ new objects in the directory bucket.\n\nWhen you use the CLI or the Amazon\
        \ Web Services SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically\
        \ to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon\
        \ Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for\
        \ the `CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption\
        \ settings values in the `CreateSession` request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint\
        \ API calls (except [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
        \ and [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)),\
        \ it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from\
        \ the `CreateSession` request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory\

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the analytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

        You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the `DataExport` request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/analytics-storage-class.html).

        You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket. For an example policy, see [Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).

        To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

        `PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration` has the following special errors:

          *     * _HTTP Error: HTTP 400 Bad Request_

            * _Code: InvalidArgument_

            * _Cause: Invalid argument._

          *     * _HTTP Error: HTTP 400 Bad Request_

            * _Code: TooManyConfigurations_

            * _Cause: You are attempting to create a new configuration but have already reached the 1,000-configuration limit._

          *     * _HTTP Error: HTTP 403 Forbidden_

            * _Code: AccessDenied_

            * _Cause: You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not have the s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration bucket permission to set the configuration on the bucket._

        \ from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets\
        \ to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html),\

        \ In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is\
        \ made for a KMS-encrypted object.\n\n    * When you specify an [KMS customer\
        \ managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)\

        \ requests.\n\nIf you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend\
        \ using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead,\
        \ then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior\
        \ can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester,\

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Deletes the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

        Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost Allocation and Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) and [Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html).

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `200 OK` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a `200 OK` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `404` response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

        This DELETE action requires the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission.

For more information about hosting websites, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

        This GET action requires the `S3:GetBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration.

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the `website` subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

        This PUT action requires the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission.

        To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.

          * `WebsiteConfiguration`

          * `RedirectAllRequestsTo`

          * `HostName`

          * `Protocol`

        If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

          * `WebsiteConfiguration`

          * `IndexDocument`

          * `Suffix`

          * `ErrorDocument`

          * `Key`

          * `RoutingRules`

          * `RoutingRule`

          * `Condition`

          * `HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`

          * `KeyPrefixEquals`

          * `Redirect`

          * `Protocol`

          * `HostName`

          * `ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`

          * `ReplaceKeyWith`

          * `HttpRedirectCode`

        Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per website configuration. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object redirect. For more information, see [Configuring an Object Redirect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        The maximum request length is limited to 128 KB.

        You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

    post:
      operationId: DeleteObjects
      description: "This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket\
        \ using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to\
        \ delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual\
        \ delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.\n\nThe request can contain\
        \ a list of up to 1,000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide\
        \ the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete\
        \ a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each\
        \ key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that\
        \ delete, success or failure, in the response. If the object specified in\
        \ the request isn't found, Amazon S3 confirms the deletion by returning the\
        \ result as deleted.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- S3 Versioning isn't\
        \ enabled and supported for directory buckets.\n\n  * **Directory buckets**\
        \ \\- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation\
        \ to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests\
        \ in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nThe operation supports two modes for the\
        \ response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode\
        \ in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your\
        \ request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete\
        \ operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode,\
        \ the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response\
        \ body.\n\nWhen performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that\
        \ attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.\
        \ If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are\
        \ non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid\
        \ token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire\
        \ Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete,\
        \ see [MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- MFA delete is\
        \ not supported by directory buckets.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General\
        \ purpose bucket permissions** \\- The following permissions are required\
        \ in your policies when your `DeleteObjects` request includes specific headers.\n\
        \n    * **`s3:DeleteObject` ** \\- To delete an object from a bucket, you\
        \ must always specify the `s3:DeleteObject` permission.\n\n    * **`s3:DeleteObjectVersion`\
        \ ** \\- To delete a specific version of an object from a versioning-enabled\
        \ bucket, you must specify the `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permission.\n\nIf\
        \ the `s3:DeleteObject` or `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` permissions are explicitly\
        \ denied in your bucket policy, attempts to delete any unversioned objects\
        \ result in a `403 Access Denied` error.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions**\
        \ \\- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend\
        \ that you use the [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\

        \nContent-MD5 request header\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose bucket** \\\
        - The Content-MD5 request header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.\
        \ Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not\
        \ been altered in transit.\n\n  * **Directory bucket** \\- The Content-MD5\
        \ request header or a additional checksum request header (including `x-amz-checksum-crc32`,\
        \ `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`, `x-amz-checksum-sha1`, or `x-amz-checksum-sha256`)\
        \ is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Retrieves the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. This operation returns the bucket-level configuration only. To understand the effective public access behavior, you must also consider account-level settings (which may inherit from organization-level policies). To use this operation, you must have the `s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).

        When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. Account-level settings automatically inherit from organization-level policies when present. If the `PublicAccessBlock` settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

        For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see [The Meaning of "Public"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status).

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        This implementation of the GET action uses the `accelerate` subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either `Enabled` or `Suspended`. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

        To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to `Enabled` or `Suspended` by using the [PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) operation.

        A GET `accelerate` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

        For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

        The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:

          * Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

          * Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

        The [GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.

        After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

        The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (".").

      description: |-
        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        This implementation of the `GET` action uses the `acl` subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use `GET` to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have the `READ_ACP` access to the bucket. If `READ_ACP` permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

        When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

        When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

        If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see [ Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

        \ To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the `WRITE_ACP` permission.\n\n\
        You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:\n\
        \n  * Specify the ACL in the request body\n\n  * Specify permissions using\
        \ request headers\n\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body\
        \ and the request headers.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you may\
        \ choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers.\
        \ For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL\
        \ using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.\n\n\
        If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership,\
        \ ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies\
        \ to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs\
        \ or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error\
        \ code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\nYou can set access\
        \ permissions by using one of the following methods:\n\n  * Specify a canned\
        \ ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined\
        \ ACLs, known as _canned ACLs_. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees\
        \ and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-acl`.\
        \ If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers\
        \ in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).\n\
        \n  * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,\
        \ `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using\
        \ these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon\
        \ Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission.\
        \ If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the `x-amz-acl` header\
        \ to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that\
        \ Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control\
        \ List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).\n\
        \nYou specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of\
        \ the following:\n\n    * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user\
        \ ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\n    * `uri` – if you are granting\
        \ permissions to a predefined group\n\n    * `emailAddress` – if the value\
        \ specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nUsing\
        \ email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following\
        \ Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\n      * US East (N. Virginia)\n\n      *\

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

        For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

      description: |-
        Using the `GetBucketLocation` operation is no longer a best practice. To return the Region that a bucket resides in, we recommend that you use the [HeadBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html) operation instead. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the `GetBucketLocation` operation.

        Returns the Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region using the `LocationConstraint` request parameter in a `CreateBucket` request. For more information, see [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html).

        In a bucket's home Region, calls to the `GetBucketLocation` operation are governed by the bucket's policy. In other Regions, the bucket policy doesn't apply, which means that cross-account access won't be authorized. However, calls to the `HeadBucket` operation always return the bucket’s location through an HTTP response header, whether access to the bucket is authorized or not. Therefore, we recommend using the `HeadBucket` operation for bucket Region discovery and to avoid using the `GetBucketLocation` operation.

        When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

        When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Returns the notification configuration of a bucket.

        If notifications are not enabled on the bucket, the action returns an empty `NotificationConfiguration` element.

        By default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification configuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration with the `s3:GetBucketNotification` permission.

        When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

        When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code `InvalidAccessPointAliasError` is returned. For more information about `InvalidAccessPointAliasError`, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event notifications, see [Configuring Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

        Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type.

        By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty `NotificationConfiguration`.

        ``

        ``

        This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body.

        After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

        You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.

        For more information about the number of event notification configurations that you can create per bucket, see [Amazon S3 service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#limits_s3) in _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

        By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with the required `s3:PutBucketNotification` permission.

        The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.

        If the configuration in the request body includes only one `TopicConfiguration` specifying only the `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` event type, the response will also include the `x-amz-sns-test-message-id` header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Returns the versioning state of a bucket.

        To retrieve the versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

        This implementation also returns the MFA Delete status of the versioning state. If the MFA Delete status is `enabled`, the bucket owner must use an authentication device to change the versioning state of the bucket.

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        When you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. While this change is propagating, you might encounter intermittent `HTTP 404 NoSuchKey` errors for requests to objects created or updated after enabling versioning. We recommend that you wait for 15 minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (`PUT` or `DELETE`) on objects in the bucket.

        Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

        You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

        **Enabled** —Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

        **Suspended** —Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

        If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value.

        In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the `x-amz-mfa request` header and the `Status` and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

        If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see [Lifecycle and Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config).

        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nIf the object is encrypted using SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key\
        \ policies for the KMS key.\n\nStorage classes\n\n    \n\nIf the object you\
        \ are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class,\
        \ the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive\
        \ Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before\
        \ you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html).\
        \ Otherwise, this operation returns an `InvalidObjectState` error. For information\
        \ about restoring archived objects, see [Restoring Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- Directory buckets\
        \ only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in\
        \ Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage\
        \ class) in Dedicated Local Zones. Unsupported storage class values won't\
        \ write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code `400\
        \ Bad Request`.\n\nEncryption\n\n    \n\nEncryption request headers, like\
        \ `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for the `GetObject` requests,\
        \ if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption\
        \ keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS)\
        \ keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services\
        \ KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your `GetObject` requests\
        \ for the object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad\
        \ Request` error.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory buckets, there\
        \ are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS.\
        \ SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see [Protecting data with server-side\
        \ encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nOverriding response header values through\
        \ the request\n\n    \n\nThere are times when you want to override certain\
        \ response header values of a `GetObject` response. For example, you might\
        \ override the `Content-Disposition` response header value through your `GetObject`\
        \ request.\n\nYou can override values for a set of response headers. These\
        \ modified response header values are included only in a successful response,\
        \ that is, when the HTTP status code `200 OK` is returned. The headers you\
        \ can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset\
        \ of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.\n\nThe\
        \ response headers that you can override for the `GetObject` response are\
        \ `Cache-Control`, `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language`,\
        \ `Content-Type`, and `Expires`.\n\nTo override values for a set of response\
        \ headers in the `GetObject` response, you can use the following query parameters\
        \ in the request.\n\n  * `response-cache-control`\n\n  * `response-content-disposition`\n\
        \n  * `response-content-encoding`\n\n  * `response-content-language`\n\n \
        \ * `response-content-type`\n\n  * `response-expires`\n\nWhen you use these\
        \ parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header\
        \ or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous)\
        \ request.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\\
        - The HTTP Host header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nThe following operations are related to `GetObject`:\n\n  * [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html)\n\
        \nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,\
        \ if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`,\
        \ you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Returns the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this operation, you must have `s3:GetObjectAcl` permissions or `READ_ACP` access to the object. For more information, see [Mapping of ACL permissions and access policy permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#acl-access-policy-permission-mapping) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_

        This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

        By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an object. To return ACL information about a different version, use the versionId subresource.

        If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see [ Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        The following operations are related to `GetObjectAcl`:

          * [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)

          * [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)

          * [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)

        You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

      description: "End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued\
        \ support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to\
        \ use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request\
        \ will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.\n\nThis change affects\
        \ the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West\
        \ (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific\
        \ (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São\

        \ the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for\
        \ a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have the `WRITE_ACP`\
        \ permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see [What\
        \ permissions can I grant?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nThis functionality is not supported for\
        \ Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you can choose\
        \ to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers.\
        \ For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL\
        \ using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more\
        \ information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nIf your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced\
        \ setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect\
        \ permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the\
        \ objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported`\
        \ error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information,\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\nYou can set access\
        \ permissions using one of the following methods:\n\n  * Specify a canned\
        \ ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined\
        \ ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees\
        \ and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-ac`l.\
        \ If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers\
        \ in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).\n\
        \n  * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,\
        \ `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using\
        \ these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon\
        \ Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission.\
        \ If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl` header\
        \ to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that\
        \ Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control\
        \ List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).\n\
        \nYou specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of\
        \ the following:\n\n    * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user\
        \ ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\n    * `uri` – if you are granting\
        \ permissions to a predefined group\n\n    * `emailAddress` – if the value\
        \ specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nUsing\
        \ email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following\
        \ Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\n      * US East (N. Virginia)\n\n      *\
        \ US West (N. California)\n\n      * US West (Oregon)\n\n      * Asia Pacific\

        \ of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)\
        \ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nFor example, the following\
        \ `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon\
        \ Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.\n\n`x-amz-grant-read:\
        \ emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\" `\n\nYou\
        \ can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You\
        \ cannot do both.\n\nGrantee Values\n\n    \n\nYou can specify the person\
        \ (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements)\
        \ in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values\
        \ in JSON format, see the Amazon Web Services CLI example in [ Enabling Amazon\
        \ S3 server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * By the person's ID:\n\n`<>ID<><>GranteesEmail<>\
        \ `\n\nDisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.\n\n  * By URI:\n\
        \n`<>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<>`\n\n  * By\
        \ Email address:\n\n`<>Grantees@email.com<>lt;/Grantee>`\n\nThe grantee is\
        \ resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,\
        \ appears as the CanonicalUser.\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee\
        \ is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\n    *\
        \ US East (N. Virginia)\n\n    * US West (N. California)\n\n    * US West\
        \ (Oregon)\n\n    * Asia Pacific (Singapore)\n\n    * Asia Pacific (Sydney)\n\
        \n    * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\n    * Europe (Ireland)\n\n    * South America\
        \ (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,\
        \ see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)\
        \ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nVersioning\n\n    \n\n\
        The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets\
        \ the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different\
        \ version, use the `versionId` subresource.\n\nThe following operations are\
        \ related to `PutObjectAcl`:\n\n  * [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\

      description: "Retrieves all of the metadata from an object without returning\
        \ the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in\
        \ an object's metadata.\n\n`GetObjectAttributes` combines the functionality\
        \ of `HeadObject` and `ListParts`. All of the data returned with both of those\
        \ individual calls can be returned with a single call to `GetObjectAttributes`.\n\
        \n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory buckets, you must make requests\
        \ for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style\
        \ requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket permissions** \\- To use `GetObjectAttributes`, you must have READ\
        \ access to the object.\n\nThe other permissions that you need to use this\
        \ operation depend on whether the bucket is versioned and if a version ID\
        \ is passed in the `GetObjectAttributes` request.\n\n    * If you pass a version\
        \ ID in your request, you need both the `s3:GetObjectVersion` and `s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes`\
        \ permissions.\n\n    * If you do not pass a version ID in your request, you\
        \ need the `s3:GetObject` and `s3:GetObjectAttributes` permissions. \n\nFor\
        \ more information, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nIf the object that you request does not\
        \ exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the\
        \ `s3:ListBucket` permission.\n\n    * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission\
        \ on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` (\"\
        no such key\") error.\n\n    * If you don't have the `s3:ListBucket` permission,\
        \ Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (\"access denied\"\
        ) error.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\- To grant access to this\
        \ API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [ `CreateSession`\
        \ ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nIf the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key\
        \ policies for the KMS key.\n\nEncryption\n\n    \n\nEncryption request headers,\
        \ like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be sent for `HEAD` requests\
        \ if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS)\
        \ keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services\
        \ KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption\
        \ keys (SSE-S3). The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you\
        \ `PUT` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you\
        \ include this header in a `GET` request for an object that uses these types\
        \ of keys, you’ll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption\
        \ method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.\n\nIf you encrypted\
        \ an object when you stored the object in Amazon S3 by using server-side encryption\
        \ with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), then when you retrieve the\
        \ metadata from the object, you must use the following headers. These headers\
        \ provide the server with the encryption key required to retrieve the object's\
        \ metadata. The headers are:\n\n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`\n\
        \n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`\n\n  * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`\n\
        \nFor more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided\
        \ Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory bucket permissions** \\- For\
        \ directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side\
        \ encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)\
        \ (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).\
        \ We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption\
        \ configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your\
        \ `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects are\
        \ automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information,\
        \ see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about the encryption\
        \ overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption\
        \ with KMS for new object uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html).\n\
        \nVersioning\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\- S3 Versioning isn't enabled\
        \ and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null`\
        \ value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only\
        \ specify `null` to the `versionId` query parameter in the request.\n\nConditional\
        \ request headers\n\n    \n\nConsider the following when using request headers:\n\
        \n  * If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present\
        \ in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code `200\
        \ OK` and the data requested:\n\n    * `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`.\n\
        \n    * `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`.\n\nFor more\
        \ information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).\n\
        \n  * If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present\
        \ in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code `304\
        \ Not Modified`:\n\n    * `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`.\n\
        \n    * `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`.\n\nFor more information\
        \ about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).\n\
        \nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\- The HTTP Host\
        \ header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nThe following actions are related to `GetObjectAttributes`:\n\n  * [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObjectLegalHold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectLegalHold.html)\n\

        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

        The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

        For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

        \ An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated\

        \ aborted.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- If multipart uploads in a directory\
        \ bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress\
        \ multipart uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress\
        \ multipart uploads, use the `ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the\
        \ in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload`\
        \ operation to abort all the in-progress multipart uploads.\n\nThe `ListMultipartUploads`\
        \ operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.\
        \ The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can\
        \ further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the `max-uploads`\
        \ request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy\
        \ your `ListMultipartUploads` request, the response returns an `IsTruncated`\
        \ element with the value of `true`, a `NextKeyMarker` element, and a `NextUploadIdMarker`\
        \ element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent\
        \ `ListMultipartUploads` requests. In these requests, include two query parameters:\
        \ `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker`. Set the value of `key-marker` to the\
        \ `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response. Similarly, set the value\
        \ of `upload-id-marker` to the `NextUploadIdMarker` value from the previous\
        \ response.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- The `upload-id-marker` element and\
        \ the `NextUploadIdMarker` element aren't supported by directory buckets.\
        \ To list the additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value\
        \ of `key-marker` to the `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response.\n\
        \nFor more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using\
        \ Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.\
        \ These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\

        \ bucket permissions** \\- For information about permissions required to use\
        \ the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\\
        - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend\
        \ that you use the [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nSorting of multipart uploads in response\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket** \\- In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads\
        \ are sorted based on two criteria:\n\n    * Key-based sorting - Multipart\
        \ uploads are initially sorted in ascending order based on their object keys.\n\
        \n    * Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object key, they\
        \ are further sorted in ascending order based on the upload initiation time.\
        \ Among uploads with the same key, the one that was initiated first will appear\
        \ before the ones that were initiated later.\n\n  * **Directory bucket** \\\
        - In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted\
        \ lexicographically based on the object keys. \n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\
        \n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\- The HTTP Host header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nThe following operations are related to `ListMultipartUploads`:\n\n  * [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n\

        \ of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of\
        \ parts in a response by specifying the `max-parts` request parameter. If\
        \ your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns\
        \ an `IsTruncated` field with the value of `true`, and a `NextPartNumberMarker`\
        \ element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent `ListParts` requests,\
        \ include the `part-number-marker` query string parameter and set its value\
        \ to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous response.\n\n\
        For more information on multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart\
        \ Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.\
        \ These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket permissions** \\- For information about permissions required to use\
        \ the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nIf the upload was created using server-side\
        \ encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer\
        \ server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you\
        \ must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` action for the `ListParts` request\
        \ to succeed.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\- To grant access\
        \ to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the\
        \ [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\- The HTTP Host\
        \ header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nThe following operations are related to `ListParts`:\n\n  * [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)\n\
        \n  * [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\n\
        \n  * [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)\n\
        \n  * [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)\n\
        \n  * [GetObjectAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html)\n\
        \n  * [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)\n\
        \nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,\
        \ if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`,\
        \ you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

        \ (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São\
        \ Paulo).\n\nAdds an object to a bucket.\n\n  * Amazon S3 never adds partial\
        \ objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object\
        \ to the bucket. You cannot use `PutObject` to only update a single piece\
        \ of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with\
        \ updated metadata if you want to update some values.\n\n  * If your bucket\
        \ uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled\
        \ and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any\
        \ account will be owned by the bucket owner.\n\n  * **Directory buckets**\
        \ \\- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation\
        \ to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests\
        \ in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\

        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nAmazon S3 is a distributed system. If\
        \ it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously,\
        \ it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides\
        \ features that can modify this behavior:\n\n  * **S3 Object Lock** \\- To\
        \ prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use [Amazon S3\
        \ Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nThis functionality is not supported for\
        \ directory buckets.\n\n  * **If-None-Match** \\- Uploads the object only\
        \ if the object key name does not already exist in the specified bucket. Otherwise,\
        \ Amazon S3 returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If a conflicting operation\
        \ occurs during the upload, S3 returns a `409 ConditionalRequestConflict`\
        \ response. On a 409 failure, retry the upload.\n\nExpects the * character\
        \ (asterisk).\n\nFor more information, see [Add preconditions to S3 operations\
        \ with conditional requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/conditional-requests.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_ or [RFC 7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7232/).\n\
        \nThis functionality is not supported for S3 on Outposts.\n\n  * **S3 Versioning**\
        \ \\- When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple\
        \ write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all versions\
        \ of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same object,\
        \ Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being\
        \ stored in Amazon S3. You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of\
        \ the object. For more information about versioning, see [Adding Objects to\
        \ Versioning-Enabled Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For information about returning the versioning\
        \ state of a bucket, see [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html).\
        \ \n\nThis functionality is not supported for directory buckets.\n\nPermissions\n\
        \n    \n\n  * **General purpose bucket permissions** \\- The following permissions\
        \ are required in your policies when your `PutObject` request includes specific\
        \ headers.\n\n    * **`s3:PutObject` ** \\- To successfully complete the `PutObject`\
        \ request, you must always have the `s3:PutObject` permission on a bucket\
        \ to add an object to it.\n\n    * **`s3:PutObjectAcl` ** \\- To successfully\
        \ change the objects ACL of your `PutObject` request, you must have the `s3:PutObjectAcl`.\n\
        \n    * **`s3:PutObjectTagging` ** \\- To successfully set the tag-set with\
        \ your `PutObject` request, you must have the `s3:PutObjectTagging`.\n\n \
        \ * **Directory bucket permissions** \\- To grant access to this API operation\
        \ on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nIf the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key\
        \ policies for the KMS key.\n\nData integrity with Content-MD5\n\n    \n\n\
        \  * **General purpose bucket** \\- To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing\
        \ the network, use the `Content-MD5` header. When you use this header, Amazon\
        \ S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not\
        \ match, Amazon S3 returns an error. Alternatively, when the object's ETag\
        \ is its MD5 digest, you can calculate the MD5 while putting the object to\
        \ Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.\n\n\
        \  * **Directory bucket** \\- This functionality is not supported for directory\
        \ buckets.\n\nHTTP Host header syntax\n\n    \n\n**Directory buckets** \\\
        - The HTTP Host header syntax is ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.\n\
        \nFor more information about related Amazon S3 APIs, see the following:\n\n\
        \  * [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\n\
        \n  * [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)\n\
        \nYou must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,\
        \ if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`,\
        \ you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`."

        \ an existing object’s name as the source and the new name of the object as\
        \ the destination within the same directory bucket.\n\n`RenameObject` is only\
        \ supported for objects stored in the S3 Express One Zone storage class.\n\
        \nTo prevent overwriting an object, you can use the `If-None-Match` conditional\
        \ header.\n\n  * **If-None-Match** \\- Renames the object only if an object\
        \ with the specified name does not already exist in the directory bucket.\
        \ If you don't want to overwrite an existing object, you can add the `If-None-Match`\
        \ conditional header with the value `‘*’` in the `RenameObject` request. Amazon\
        \ S3 then returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error if the object with the\
        \ specified name already exists. For more information, see [RFC 7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7232/).\n\
        \nPermissions\n\n    \n\nTo grant access to the `RenameObject` operation on\
        \ a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `CreateSession` operation\
        \ for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession`\
        \ permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based\
        \ policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the directory bucket\
        \ to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header,\
        \ you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,\
        \ you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token\
        \ for use. The Amazon Web Services CLI and SDKs will create and manage your\
        \ session including refreshing the session token automatically to avoid service\
        \ interruptions when a session expires. In your bucket policy, you can specify\
        \ the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to control who can create a `ReadWrite`\
        \ or `ReadOnly` session. A `ReadWrite` session is required for executing all\
        \ the Zonal endpoint API operations, including `RenameObject`. For more information\
        \ about authorization, see [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\
        \ To learn more about Zonal endpoint API operations, see [Authorizing Zonal\
        \ endpoint API operations with CreateSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-create-session.html)\

        \ you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive\
        \ storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering\
        \ Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the\
        \ S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,\
        \ you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary\
        \ copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object,\
        \ create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket.\
        \ To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration\
        \ (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or\
        \ Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate\
        \ a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent\
        \ Access tier.\n\nTo restore a specific object version, you can provide a\
        \ version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current\
        \ version.\n\nWhen restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the\
        \ following data access tier options in the `Tier` element of the request\
        \ body:\n\n  * `Expedited` \\- Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access\
        \ your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3\
        \ Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring\
        \ archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+),\
        \ data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within\
        \ 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited\
        \ retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned\
        \ capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive\
        \ storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.\n\n  * `Standard`\
        \ \\- Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects\
        \ within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests\
        \ that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically\
        \ finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\
        \ storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish\
        \ within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage\
        \ class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are\
        \ free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.\n\n  * `Bulk` \\- Bulk\
        \ retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\
        \ and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large\
        \ amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish\
        \ within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\
        \ storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are\
        \ also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier\
        \ Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in\
        \ the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep\
        \ Archive tier. \n\nFor more information about archive retrieval options and\
        \ provisioned capacity for `Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived\
        \ Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nYou can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade\
        \ to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For\
        \ more information, see [ Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nTo get the status of object restoration,\
        \ you can send a `HEAD` request. Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header,\
        \ which provides information about the restoration status, in the response.\
        \ You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is\
        \ initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3\
        \ Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nAfter restoring an archived object, you\
        \ can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period.\
        \ Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and\
        \ charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot\
        \ update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your\
        \ current restore request for the object.\n\nIf your bucket has a lifecycle\
        \ configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object\
        \ expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request.\
        \ For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is\
        \ scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For\
        \ more information about lifecycle configuration, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html)\

        \ in _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nResponses\n\n    \n\nA successful action returns\
        \ either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted` status code.\n\n  * If the object\
        \ is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns `202 Accepted` in the\
        \ response. \n\n  * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns\
        \ `200 OK` in the response. \n\n  * Special errors:\n\n    * _Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress_\n\

      operationId: UploadPart
      description: "Uploads a part in a multipart upload.\n\nIn this operation, you\
        \ provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have\
        \ an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for\
        \ the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you\
        \ use the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)\
        \ operation.\n\nYou must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html))\
        \ before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon\
        \ S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your\
        \ upload part request.\n\nPart numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000,\
        \ inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its\
        \ position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using\
        \ the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously\
        \ uploaded part is overwritten.\n\nFor information about maximum and minimum\
        \ part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see [Multipart upload\
        \ limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nAfter you initiate multipart upload and\
        \ upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload\
        \ in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only\
        \ after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up\
        \ the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\n\nFor more\
        \ information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.\
        \ These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\
        \ in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets\
        \ in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local\
        \ Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ bucket permissions** \\- To perform a multipart upload with encryption using\
        \ an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the\
        \ `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester\
        \ must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the\
        \ `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the\
        \ `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs.\n\n\
        These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data\
        \ from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.\
        \ For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side\
        \ encryption with KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For information about the permissions required\
        \ to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html)\
        \ and [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\\
        - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend\
        \ that you use the [ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html)\
        \ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the\
        \ `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket\
        \ policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession`\
        \ API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token\
        \ in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After\
        \ the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to\
        \ generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create\
        \ session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions\
        \ when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [\
        \ `CreateSession` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).\n\
        \nIf the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key\
        \ policies for the KMS key.\n\nData integrity\n\n    \n\n**General purpose\
        \ bucket** \\- To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network,\
        \ specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks\
        \ the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon\
        \ S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version\
        \ 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as\
        \ a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating\
        \ Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature\
        \ Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).\n\
        \n**Directory buckets** \\- MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You\
        \ can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.\n\nEncryption\n\n\
        \    \n\n  * **General purpose bucket** \\- Server-side encryption is for\
        \ data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to\
        \ disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually\
        \ exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon\
        \ S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically,\
        \ the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web\
        \ Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon\
        \ S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys\
        \ (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at\
        \ rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you\
        \ use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your\
        \ own encryption key (SSE-C).\n\nServer-side encryption is supported by the\
        \ S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided\
        \ encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters\
        \ in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side\
        \ encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more\
        \ information, see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).\n\
        \nIf you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked\
        \ for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied\
        \ error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data\
        \ to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C\
        \ for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).\n\
        \nIf you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption\
        \ key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide\
        \ identical encryption information in each part upload using the following\
        \ request headers.\n\n    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n\
        \n    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n\n    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n\
        \nFor more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption:\
        \ server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and\
        \ server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).\n\nSpecial errors\n\
        \n    \n\n  * Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`\n\n    * Description: The specified\
        \ multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the\
        \ multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.\n\n    * HTTP Status\

      description: "Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data\
        \ source. To specify the data source, you add the request header `x-amz-copy-source`\
        \ in your request. To specify a byte range, you add the request header `x-amz-copy-source-range`\
        \ in your request.\n\nFor information about maximum and minimum part sizes\
        \ and other multipart upload specifications, see [Multipart upload limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nInstead of copying data from an existing\
        \ object as part data, you might use the [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)\
        \ action to upload new data as a part of an object in your request.\n\nYou\
        \ must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response\
        \ to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier\
        \ that you must include in your upload part request.\n\nFor conceptual information\
        \ about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For information about copying objects using\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**Directory buckets** \\- For directory\
        \ buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.\
        \ These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://_amzn-s3-demo-bucket_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com/_key-name_\
        \ `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nAuthentication and authorization\n\n \
        \   \n\nAll `UploadPartCopy` requests must be authenticated and signed by\
        \ using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities).\
        \ All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must\
        \ be signed. For more information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html).\n\
        \n**Directory buckets** \\- You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and\
        \ authorize your access to the `UploadPartCopy` API operation, instead of\
        \ using the temporary security credentials through the `CreateSession` API\
        \ operation.\n\nAmazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and\
        \ authorization on your behalf.\n\nPermissions\n\n    \n\nYou must have `READ`\
        \ access to the source object and `WRITE` access to the destination bucket.\n\
        \n  * **General purpose bucket permissions** \\- You must have the permissions\
        \ in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination\
        \ bucket in an `UploadPartCopy` operation.\n\n    * If the source object is\
        \ in a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:GetObject` ** permission\
        \ to read the source object that is being copied. \n\n    * If the destination\
        \ bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the **`s3:PutObject` **\
        \ permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket. \n\n    *\
        \ To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service\
        \ key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey`\
        \ action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions\
        \ for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs.\
        \ These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data\
        \ from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload.\
        \ For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side\
        \ encryption with KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For information about the permissions required\

        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n  * **Directory bucket permissions** \\\
        - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy\
        \ based on the source and destination bucket types in an `UploadPartCopy`\
        \ operation.\n\n    * If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory\
        \ bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession` ** permission in the\
        \ `Action` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session\
        \ is in the `ReadWrite` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can\
        \ explicitly set the `s3express:SessionMode` condition key to `ReadOnly` on\
        \ the copy source bucket.\n\n    * If the copy destination is a directory\
        \ bucket, you must have the **`s3express:CreateSession` ** permission in the\
        \ `Action` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The\
        \ `s3express:SessionMode` condition key cannot be set to `ReadOnly` on the\
        \ copy destination. \n\nIf the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must\
        \ also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM\
        \ identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.\n\nFor example\
        \ policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html)\
        \ and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based\
        \ policies for S3 Express One Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nEncryption\n\n    \n\n  * **General purpose\
        \ buckets** \\- For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided\
        \ encryption keys with the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)\
        \ and [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html).\
        \ \n\nIf you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)\
        \ blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access\
        \ Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new\
        \ data to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C\
        \ for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).\n\
        \n  * **Directory buckets** \\- For directory buckets, there are only two\
        \ supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with\
        \ Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with\
        \ KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`). For more information, see [Protecting data\
        \ with server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\
        \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\nFor directory buckets, when you perform\
        \ a `CreateMultipartUpload` operation and an `UploadPartCopy` operation, the\
        \ request headers you provide in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request must\
        \ match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.\n\n\
        S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from\
        \ general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to\
        \ general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html).\
        \ In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is\
        \ made for a KMS-encrypted object.\n\nSpecial errors\n\n    \n\n  * Error\
        \ Code: `NoSuchUpload`\n\n    * Description: The specified multipart upload\
        \ does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload\
        \ might have been aborted or completed.\n\n    * HTTP Status Code: 404 Not\

      description: |-
        This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

        Passes transformed objects to a `GetObject` operation when using Object Lambda access points. For information about Object Lambda access points, see [Transforming objects with Object Lambda access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transforming-objects.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        This operation supports metadata that can be returned by [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html), in addition to `RequestRoute`, `RequestToken`, `StatusCode`, `ErrorCode`, and `ErrorMessage`. The `GetObject` response metadata is supported so that the `WriteGetObjectResponse` caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes `GetObject`. When `WriteGetObjectResponse` is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user `GetObject` call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return.

        You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with `x-amz-meta`. For example, `x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue`. The primary use case for this is to forward `GetObject` metadata.

        Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point.

        Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

        Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

        Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.

        For information on how to view and use these functions, see [Using Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/olap-examples.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

        You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)

            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)

            Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn''t supported
            when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web Services Local
            Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon
            Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error
            with the error code `InvalidRequest`.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must use the Outpost bucket access point ARN or the access point alias
            for the destination bucket. You can only copy objects within the same
            Outpost bucket. It''s not supported to copy objects across different Amazon
            Web Services Outposts, between buckets on the same Outposts, or between
            Outposts buckets and any other bucket types. For more information about
            S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
            in the _S3 on Outposts guide_. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts
            through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname,
            in the format ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            The hostname isn''t required when you use the Amazon Web Services CLI
            or SDKs.'

            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            When you copy an object, if the source object has a checksum, that checksum
            value will be copied to the new object by default. If the `CopyObject`
            request does not include this `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header, the checksum
            algorithm will be copied from the source object to the destination object
            (if it''s present on the source object). You can optionally specify a
            different checksum algorithm to use with the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm`
            header. Unrecognized or unsupported values will respond with the HTTP
            status code `400 Bad Request`.

            \ part object after the source object is copied to the destination bucket.\n\
            \nYou specify the value of the copy source in one of two formats, depending\
            \ on whether you want to access the source object through an [access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):\n\
            \n  * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name\
            \ of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by\
            \ a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from\
            \ the general purpose bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded. To copy the object `reports/january.pdf`\
            \ from the directory bucket `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3`, use `awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\n  * For objects accessed through access\
            \ points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed\
            \ through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/`.\
            \ For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access\
            \ point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`,\
            \ use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL encoded.\n\n    * Amazon S3 supports copy operations\
            \ using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are\
            \ in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\n    * Access points are not\
            \ supported by directory buckets.\n\nAlternatively, for objects accessed\
            \ through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed\
            \ in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/`. For example,\
            \ to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost`\
            \ owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding\
            \ of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\nIf your source bucket versioning is\
            \ enabled, the `x-amz-copy-source` header by default identifies the current\
            \ version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker,\
            \ Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different\
            \ version, use the `versionId` query parameter. Specifically, append `?versionId=`\
            \ to the value (for example, `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).\
            \ If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version\
            \ of the source object.\n\nIf you enable versioning on the destination\
            \ bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the copied object.\
            \ This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object.\
            \ Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the `x-amz-version-id`\
            \ response header in the response.\n\nIf you do not enable versioning\
            \ or suspend it on the destination bucket, the version ID that Amazon\

            \nAmazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to\
            \ an S3 bucket. When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption\
            \ information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target\
            \ object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination\
            \ bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration\
            \ that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\
            \ If the destination bucket has a different default encryption configuration,\
            \ Amazon S3 uses the corresponding encryption key to encrypt the target\
            \ object copy.\n\nWith server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your\
            \ data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts\
            \ the data when you access it. For more information about server-side\
            \ encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html)\
            \ in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.\n\n**General purpose buckets**\n\n  *\
            \ For general purpose buckets, there are the following supported options\
            \ for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Key Management\
            \ Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with\
            \ Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), and server-side encryption\
            \ with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 uses the corresponding\
            \ KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.\n\
            \n  * When you perform a `CopyObject` operation, if you want to use a\
            \ different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can\
            \ specify appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target\
            \ object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided\
            \ key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the\
            \ default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption\
            \ setting in your request takes precedence. \n\n**Directory buckets**\n\
            \n  * For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for\
            \ server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed\
            \ keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS)\
            \ (`aws:kms`). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses\
            \ the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket\
            \ default encryption in your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object\
            \ requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired\
            \ encryption settings. For more information, see [Protecting data with\
            \ server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)\

            \n  * To encrypt new object copies to a directory bucket with SSE-KMS,\
            \ we recommend you specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption\
            \ configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)).\

            \ per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify\
            \ a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer\
            \ managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration. Then, when you perform\
            \ a `CopyObject` operation and want to specify server-side encryption\
            \ settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS in the encryption-related\
            \ request headers, you must ensure the encryption key is the same customer\
            \ managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption\
            \ configuration. \n\n  * **S3 access points for Amazon FSx** \\- When\
            \ accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points,\
            \ the only valid server side encryption option is `aws:fsx`. All Amazon\
            \ FSx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted\
            \ at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the\
            \ file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes\

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            \ your `CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects\

            with `aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID (Key ID,
            Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS key to use. If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`
            or `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,
            Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) to protect
            the data.


            **Directory buckets** \- To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it''s recommended
            to specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms`. Then,
            the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header implicitly uses
            the bucket''s default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly
            set the ` x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header, it must
            match the bucket''s default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN,
            not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed
            key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)
            per directory bucket''s lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk)
            (`aws/s3`) isn''t supported. Incorrect key specification results in an
            HTTP `400 Bad Request` error.'

            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you

            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be

            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For

            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information

            \ (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).\
            \ We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption\

            contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored
            as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web Services
            KMS for future `GetObject` operations on this object.


            **General purpose buckets** \- This value must be explicitly added during
            `CopyObject` operations if you want an additional encryption context for
            your object. For more information, see [Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Directory buckets** \- You can optionally provide an explicit encryption
            context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the
            bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value
            is not supported.'

            (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).


            **General purpose buckets** \- Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon
            S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Also, specifying
            this header with a PUT action doesn''t affect bucket-level settings for

            **Directory buckets** \- S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and
            `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket
            Keys aren''t supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general
            purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general
            purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html),

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn''t supported
            when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web Services Local
            Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon
            Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error
            with the error code `InvalidRequest`.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)

            \n  * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name\
            \ of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash\
            \ (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` from the\
            \ bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\n  * For objects accessed through access\
            \ points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed\
            \ through the access point, in the format `arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/`.\
            \ For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access\

            \ use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL encoded.\n\n    * Amazon S3 supports copy operations\
            \ using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are\
            \ in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\n    * Access points are not\
            \ supported by directory buckets.\n\nAlternatively, for objects accessed\
            \ through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed\
            \ in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/`. For example,\
            \ to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through outpost `my-outpost`\
            \ owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding\
            \ of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.\
            \ The value must be URL-encoded.\n\nIf your bucket has versioning enabled,\
            \ you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source`\
            \ identifies the current version of the source object to copy. To copy\
            \ a specific version of the source object to copy, append `?versionId=`\
            \ to the `x-amz-copy-source` request header (for example, `x-amz-copy-source:\
            \ /awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).\n\
            \nIf the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId\
            \ in the `x-amz-copy-source` request header, Amazon S3 returns a `404\
            \ Not Found` error, because the object does not exist. If you specify\

            **Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory
            bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ` _Bucket-name_.s3express-_zone-id_._region-code_.amazonaws.com`.
            Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
            unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names
            must follow the format ` _bucket-base-name_ --_zone-id_ --x-s3` (for example,
            ` _amzn-s3-demo-bucket_ --_usw2-az1_ --x-s3`). For information about bucket
            naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
            in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.


            **Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for
            general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
            in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
            use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide
            the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access
            point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The
            access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com.
            When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services
            SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For
            more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)

            Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.


            **S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
            must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
            hostname takes the form ` _AccessPointName_ -_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com`.
            When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must
            be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information
            about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
