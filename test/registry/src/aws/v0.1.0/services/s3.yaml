      description: '<p>Passes transformed objects to a <code>GetObject</code> operation
        when using Object Lambda access points. For information about Object Lambda
        access points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transforming-objects.html">Transforming
        objects with Object Lambda access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>
        <p>This operation supports metadata that can be returned by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html">GetObject</a>,
        in addition to <code>RequestRoute</code>, <code>RequestToken</code>, <code>StatusCode</code>,
        <code>ErrorCode</code>, and <code>ErrorMessage</code>. The <code>GetObject</code>
        response metadata is supported so that the <code>WriteGetObjectResponse</code>
        caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it
        internally invokes <code>GetObject</code>. When <code>WriteGetObjectResponse</code>
        is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the
        end user <code>GetObject</code> call might differ from what Amazon S3 would
        normally return.</p> <p>You can include any number of metadata headers. When
        including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with <code>x-amz-meta</code>.
        For example, <code>x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue</code>. The
        primary use case for this is to forward <code>GetObject</code> metadata.</p>
        <p>Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can
        use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information
        (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the
        Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected
        through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object
        Lambda access point.</p> <p>Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function
        uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using
        machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically
        detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses,
        dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in
        your Amazon S3 bucket. </p> <p>Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function
        uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using
        machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically
        redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses,
        dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in
        your Amazon S3 bucket. </p> <p>Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function
        S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3
        in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib,
        zstandard and ZIP. </p> <p>For information on how to view and use these functions,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/olap-examples.html">Using
        Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>'

        \ to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1\
        \ Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must\
        \ use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request\
        \ specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create\
        \ a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application\
        \ must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see <a href=\"\
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html\">Virtual\
        \ hosting of buckets</a>.</p> </note> <p> <b>Access control lists (ACLs)</b>\
        \ </p> <p>When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally\
        \ configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should be\
        \ granted specific permissions on the bucket.</p> <important> <p>If your CreateBucket\
        \ request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object Ownership and specifies\
        \ a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account,\
        \ your request fails with a <code>400</code> error and returns the <code>InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership</code>\
        \ error code. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html\"\
        >Controlling object ownership</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>\
        \ </important> <p>There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions\
        \ using the request headers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL using the\
        \ <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined\
        \ ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set\
        \ of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\"\
        >Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly using\
        \ the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,\
        \ <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code>\
        \ headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports\
        \ in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html\"\
        >Access control list (ACL) overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as\
        \ a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>\
        \ <p> <code>id</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the canonical user\
        \ ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code>\
        \ \u2013 if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li>\
        \ <p> <code>emailAddress</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the email\
        \ address of an Amazon Web Services account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses\
        \ to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services\
        \ Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N. Virginia)</p> </li> <li> <p>US West\
        \ (N. California)</p> </li> <li> <p> US West (Oregon)</p> </li> <li> <p> Asia\

        >Regions and Endpoints</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.</p>\
        \ </note> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>\
        \ header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs\
        \ permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read:\
        \ id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\" </code> </p> </li> </ul> <note>\
        \ <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly.\
        \ You cannot do both.</p> </note> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>In addition\
        \ to <code>s3:CreateBucket</code>, the following permissions are required\
        \ when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>ACLs</b>\
        \ - If your <code>CreateBucket</code> request specifies ACL permissions and\
        \ the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you\
        \ specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both <code>s3:CreateBucket</code>\
        \ and <code>s3:PutBucketAcl</code> permissions are needed. If the ACL the\
        \ <code>CreateBucket</code> request is private or doesn't specify any ACLs,\
        \ only <code>s3:CreateBucket</code> permission is needed. </p> </li> <li>\
        \ <p> <b>Object Lock</b> - If <code>ObjectLockEnabledForBucket</code> is set\
        \ to true in your <code>CreateBucket</code> request, <code>s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration</code>\
        \ and <code>s3:PutBucketVersioning</code> permissions are required.</p> </li>\
        \ <li> <p> <b>S3 Object Ownership</b> - If your CreateBucket request includes\
        \ the the <code>x-amz-object-ownership</code> header, <code>s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls</code>\
        \ permission is required.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following operations are\

        \ response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when\
        \ status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using\
        \ these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when\
        \ you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the\
        \ GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>,\
        \ <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>,\
        \ and <code>Content-Encoding</code>. To override these header values in the\
        \ GET response, you use the following request parameters.</p> <note> <p>You\
        \ must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned\
        \ URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous)\
        \ request.</p> </note> <ul> <li> <p> <code>response-content-type</code> </p>\

        write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
        last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need
        this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning
        instead.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network,
        use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon
        S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match,
        returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an
        object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p>

        S3 Object Lock Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> </li>
        </ul> </note> <p> <b>Server-side Encryption</b> </p> <p>You can optionally
        request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts
        your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data
        when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key
        or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For
        more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using
        Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If you request server-side encryption using
        Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3
        Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon
        S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Access Control
        List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> </p> <p>You can use headers to grant
        ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner
        has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions
        to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For
        more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access
        Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing
        ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p> <p>If the bucket that you're uploading objects
        to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are
        disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only
        accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify
        bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the <code>bucket-owner-full-control</code>
        canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.
        PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain
        Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a <code>400</code> error with
        the error code <code>AccessControlListNotSupported</code>.</p> <p>For more
        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html">
        Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
        User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced
        setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account
        will be owned by the bucket owner.</p> </note> <p> <b>Storage Class Options</b>
        </p> <p>By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
        created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high
        availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different
        Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.
        For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage
        Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b>
        </p> <p>If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates
        a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID
        in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives
        multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all
        of the objects.</p> <p>For more information about versioning, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html">Adding
        Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets</a>. For information about returning
        the versioning state of a bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html">GetBucketVersioning</a>.

        to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you
        are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a>
        operation. </p> </note> <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>)
        before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon
        S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your
        upload part request.</p> <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000,
        inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position
        within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
        number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is
        overwritten.</p> <p>For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and
        other multipart upload specifications, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html">Multipart

        data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the <code>Content-MD5</code>
        header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against
        the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
        </p> <p>If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon
        Web Services S3 uses the <code>x-amz-content-sha256</code> header as a checksum
        instead of <code>Content-MD5</code>. For more information see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html">Authenticating
        Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version
        4)</a>. </p> <p> <b>Note:</b> After you initiate multipart upload and upload
        one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order
        to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
        either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage
        and stops charging you for the parts storage.</p> <p>For more information

        operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you
        call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon
        S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create
        a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the
        parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates
        the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must
        provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code> value, returned after that
        part was uploaded.</p> <p>Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request
        could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing
        the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response.
        While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space
        characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could
        fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that
        you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.</p>
        <p>Note that if <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code> fails, applications should
        be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html">Amazon

        action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must
        use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more
        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html">Copy
        Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p> </note> <p>All copy requests
        must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the

        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">REST
        Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from
        and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your
        account.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives
        the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
        before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If
        the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded
        in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code>
        response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application
        to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If
        the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the
        copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response
        is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length,
        and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>The copy request

        support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer
        acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more
        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">Transfer
        Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p> <b>Metadata</b> </p> <p>When copying
        an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata.
        However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making
        the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating
        a copy request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using
        ACLs</a>. </p> <p>To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from
        the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
        optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you
        grant permissions, you can use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code>
        condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded.
        For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html">Specifying
        Conditions in a Policy</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For a complete

        Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3</a>.</p> <p> <b>x-amz-copy-source-if
        Headers</b> </p> <p>To only copy an object under certain conditions, such
        as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was modified
        before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>
        </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> </p>
        </li> </ul> <p> If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>
        headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns
        <code>200 OK</code> and copies the data:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>
        condition evaluates to true</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>
        condition evaluates to false</p> </li> </ul> <p>If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>
        and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in
        the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition
        Failed</code> response code:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>
        condition evaluates to false</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>
        condition evaluates to true</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>All headers with the
        <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must
        be signed.</p> </note> <p> <b>Server-side encryption</b> </p> <p>When you
        perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related
        headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web
        Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided
        encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data
        as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you
        access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using
        Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can
        enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon
        S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Access Control
        List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> </p> <p>When copying an object, you
        can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all
        objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a
        new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts
        or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added
        to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access
        Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing
        ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p> <p>If the bucket that you're copying objects
        to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are
        disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only
        accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify
        bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the <code>bucket-owner-full-control</code>
        canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html">
        Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
        User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced
        setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account
        will be owned by the bucket owner.</p> </note> <p> <b>Checksums</b> </p> <p>When
        copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be copied to the
        new object by default. When you copy the object over, you may optionally specify
        a different checksum algorithm to use with the <code>x-amz-checksum-algorithm</code>
        header.</p> <p> <b>Storage Class Options</b> </p> <p>You can use the <code>CopyObject</code>
        action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in
        Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage
        Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b>
        </p> <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current
        version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon
        S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
        the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on
        the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object
        being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source
        object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code>
        response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or
        suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is
        always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must
        restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for
        the copy operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html">RestoreObject</a>.</p>

          The value must be URL-encoded.</p> </li> <li> <p>For objects accessed through

          outpost <code>my-outpost</code> owned by account <code>123456789012</code>
          in Region <code>us-west-2</code>, use the URL encoding of <code>arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf</code>.
          The value must be URL-encoded. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To copy a specific version

        \ explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p> </li> <li>\
        \ <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object.\
        \ Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p>\
        \ </li> <li> <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has\
        \ already been restored. A select request doesn\u2019t return error response\
        \ <code>409</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Restoring objects</b> </p> <p>Objects\
        \ that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class,\
        \ and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive\
        \ tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or\
        \ Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and\
        \ then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects\
        \ in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first\
        \ initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the\
        \ object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the\
        \ object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.</p> <p>To restore\
        \ a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide\
        \ a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring\
        \ an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the\
        \ following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the\
        \ request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Expedited</code> - Expedited retrievals\
        \ allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class\
        \ or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for\
        \ a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects\
        \ (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available\
        \ within 1\u20135 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity\
        \ for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals\
        \ and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3\
        \ Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive\
        \ tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Standard</code> - Standard retrievals allow\
        \ you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is\
        \ the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval\
        \ option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3\u20135 hours for objects\
        \ stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive\
        \ tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3\
        \ Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive\
        \ tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p>\
        \ </li> <li> <p> <code>Bulk</code> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval\
        \ option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes,\
        \ of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5\u201312\
        \ hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering\
        \ Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in\
        \ the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep\
        \ Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p>\

        \ a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code>\
        \ header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the\
        \ response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a\
        \ restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"\

        \ <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period\
        \ by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration\
        \ period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there\
        \ are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when\
        \ Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p>\
        \ <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes\
        \ an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that\
        \ you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object\
        \ copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon\
        \ S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration,\

        \ the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise,\
        \ the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and\

        >Multipart Upload and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>For request signing, multipart\
        \ upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload,\
        \ send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart\
        \ upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special\
        \ about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing,\
        \ see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\"\
        >Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>.</p>\
        \ <note> <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more\
        \ parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either\
        \ complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used\
        \ to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you\
        \ either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>You can optionally\
        \ request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts\
        \ your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when\
        \ you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web\
        \ Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to\
        \ provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href=\"\
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a>\
        \ and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\"\
        >UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request\
        \ to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p>\
        \ <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services\
        \ KMS key, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code>\
        \ and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions\
        \ are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted\
        \ file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information,\
        \ see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions\"\
        >Multipart upload API and permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>\
        \ <p>If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same\
        \ Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions\
        \ on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account\
        \ than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy\

        \ access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see\
        \ <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\"\

        \ you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services\

        \ these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header\
        \ to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that\

        default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.</p>
        <p>You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin
        requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is
        <code>http://www.example.com</code> to access your Amazon S3 bucket at <code>my.example.bucket.com</code>
        by using the browser's <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> capability.</p> <p>To enable
        cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the <code>cors</code>
        subresource to the bucket. The <code>cors</code> subresource is an XML document
        in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that
        can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.
        </p> <p>When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS
        request) against a bucket, it evaluates the <code>cors</code> configuration
        on the bucket and uses the first <code>CORSRule</code> rule that matches the
        incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match,
        the following conditions must be met:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The request's <code>Origin</code>
        header must match <code>AllowedOrigin</code> elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
        request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code>
        header in case of a pre-flight <code>OPTIONS</code> request must be one of
        the <code>AllowedMethod</code> elements. </p> </li> <li> <p>Every header specified
        in the <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> request header of a pre-flight
        request must match an <code>AllowedHeader</code> element. </p> </li> </ul>

      description: '<p>This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket
        using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to
        delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual
        delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.</p> <p>The request contains
        a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide
        the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a
        specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each
        key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete,
        success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in
        the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.</p> <p>
        The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default,
        the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of
        deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes
        only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion,
        the action does not return any information about the delete in the response
        body.</p> <p>When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket,
        that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.
        If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are
        non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid
        token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire
        Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete">
        MFA Delete</a>.</p> <p>Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all

        <p>Default encryption for a bucket can use server-side encryption with Amazon
        S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer managed keys (SSE-KMS). If you specify
        default encryption using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3 Bucket
        Key. When the default encryption is SSE-KMS, if you upload an object to the
        bucket and do not specify the KMS key to use for encryption, Amazon S3 uses
        the default Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for your account. For information

        details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information
        about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Managing
        your storage lifecycle</a>.</p> <note> <p>Bucket lifecycle configuration now
        supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one
        or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes
        the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based
        only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
        For the related API description, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html">PutBucketLifecycle</a>.</p>
        </note> <p> <b>Rules</b> </p> <p>You specify the lifecycle configuration in
        your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting
        of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to
        1,000 rules. This limit is not adjustable. Each rule consists of the following:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p>Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
        The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination
        of both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Status whether the rule is in effect.</p> </li>
        <li> <p>One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want
        Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state
        of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have
        many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent
        versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for
        current and noncurrent object versions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object
        Lifecycle Management</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html">Lifecycle
        Configuration Elements</a>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>By default,
        all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related
        subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration).
        Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created
        it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access
        permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user
        must get the <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> permission.</p> <p>You
        can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other
        permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting
        objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following
        actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>s3:DeleteObject</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>s3:DeleteObjectVersion</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code>

        Event Notifications</a>.</p> <p>Using this API, you can replace an existing
        notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines
        the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where
        you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event
        of the specified type.</p> <p>By default, your bucket has no event notifications
        configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty <code>NotificationConfiguration</code>.</p>
        <p> <code>&lt;NotificationConfiguration&gt;</code> </p> <p> <code>&lt;/NotificationConfiguration&gt;</code>
        </p> <p>This action replaces the existing notification configuration with
        the configuration you include in the request body.</p> <p>After Amazon S3
        receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification
        Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination
        exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending
        a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies
        that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke
        the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
        Notifications for Amazon S3 Events</a>.</p> <p>You can disable notifications
        by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.</p> <p>For more information
        about the number of event notification configurations that you can create
        per bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#limits_s3">Amazon
        S3 service quotas</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
        <p>By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket.
        However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other
        users to set this configuration with <code>s3:PutBucketNotification</code>
        permission.</p> <note> <p>The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For
        example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue,
        and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this
        configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message
        fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration
        to your bucket.</p> </note> <p> <b>Responses</b> </p> <p>If the configuration
        in the request body includes only one <code>TopicConfiguration</code> specifying
        only the <code>s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject</code> event type, the response
        will also include the <code>x-amz-sns-test-message-id</code> header containing
        the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.</p> <p>The following

        objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your
        behalf, and other relevant information.</p> <p>A replication configuration
        must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule
        identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the
        source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a
        rule for each subset.</p> <p>To specify a subset of the objects in the source
        bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of
        the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one
        or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration,
        you must also add the following elements: <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code>,
        <code>Status</code>, and <code>Priority</code>.</p> <note> <p>If you are using
        an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication
        of delete markers differently. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations">Backward
        Compatibility</a>.</p> </note> <p>For information about enabling versioning
        on a bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html">Using
        Versioning</a>.</p> <p> <b>Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects</b> </p>
        <p>By default, Amazon S3 doesn''t replicate objects that are stored at rest
        using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services
        KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: <code>SourceSelectionCriteria</code>,
        <code>SseKmsEncryptedObjects</code>, <code>Status</code>, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>,
        and <code>ReplicaKmsKeyID</code>. For information about replication configuration,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html">Replicating
        Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys</a>.</p> <p>For information on <code>PutBucketReplication</code>
        errors, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList">List
        of replication-related error codes</a> </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>To
        create a <code>PutBucketReplication</code> request, you must have <code>s3:PutReplicationConfiguration</code>
        permissions for the bucket. </p> <p>By default, a resource owner, in this
        case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform
        this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform
