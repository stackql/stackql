        To see many of the organization response values, you need to be an authenticated organization owner with the `admin:org` scope. When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`, the organization requires all members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

        GitHub Apps with the `Organization plan` permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information about an organization's GitHub plan. See "[Authenticating with GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/)" for details. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below."

        **Parameter Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will replace and discontinue `members_allowed_repository_creation_type` in favor of more granular permissions. The new input parameters are `members_can_create_public_repositories`, `members_can_create_private_repositories` for all organizations and `members_can_create_internal_repositories` for organizations associated with an enterprise account using GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-12-03-internal-visibility-changes).

        An authenticated organization owner with the `admin:org` scope can remove a credential authorization for an organization that uses SAML SSO. Once you remove someone's credential authorization, they will need to create a new personal access token or SSH key and authorize it for the organization they want to access.

        Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the organization or update the member's role.

        *   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a member to the organization, the invited user will receive an email inviting them to the organization. The user's [membership status](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/orgs#get-organization-membership-for-a-user) will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.
            
        *   Authenticated users can _update_ a user's membership by passing the `role` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to `admin`, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.

        **Rate limits**

        To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization invitations per 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.

        **OAuth scope requirements**

        This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a `403 Forbidden` response.
