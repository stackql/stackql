        When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:

        *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
        *   `repo` scope to create a private repository

        Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

        When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can use this endpoint to check whether a branch requires signed commits. An enabled status of `true` indicates you must sign commits on this branch. For more information, see [Signing commits with GPG](https://docs.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg) in GitHub Help.

        **Note**: You must enable branch protection to require signed commits.

        Renames a branch in a repository.

        **Note:** Although the API responds immediately, the branch rename process might take some extra time to complete in the background. You won't be able to push to the old branch name while the rename process is in progress. For more information, see "[Renaming a branch](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch)".

        The permissions required to use this endpoint depends on whether you are renaming the default branch.

        To rename a non-default branch:

        * Users must have push access.
        * GitHub Apps must have the `contents:write` repository permission.

        To rename the default branch:

        * Users must have admin or owner permissions.
        * GitHub Apps must have the `administration:write` repository permission.

        This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.

        For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:

        ```
        Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
        ```

        Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

        The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [repository invitations API endpoints](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#invitations).

        **Rate limits**

        You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | ----- | ----------- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

      description: |-
        Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.

        **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.

        You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to  fetch `diff` and `patch` formats. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.

        To return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | ----- | ----------- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

        The `basehead` param is comprised of two parts: `base` and `head`. Both must be branch names in `repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`.

        The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.

        The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.

        **Working with large comparisons**

        To process a response with a large number of commits, you can use (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using paging, the list of changed files is only returned with page 1, but includes all changed files for the entire comparison. For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."

        When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | ----- | ----------- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

    get:
      summary: Get repository content
      description: |-
        Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory in `:path`. If you omit
        `:path`, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. See the description below regarding what the API response includes for directories. 

        Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) for
        retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media
        type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) to ensure the content is returned in a consistent
        object format.

        **Note**:
        *   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#trees).
        *   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees
        API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#get-a-tree).
        *   This API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.

        #### If the content is a directory
        The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
        When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
        _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
        In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".

        #### If the content is a symlink 
        If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
        API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object 
        describing the symlink itself.

        #### If the content is a submodule
        The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
        commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
        the submodule at that specific commit.

        If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
        github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

        Lists contributors to the specified repository and sorts them by the number of commits per contributor in descending order. This endpoint may return information that is a few hours old because the GitHub REST API v3 caches contributor data to improve performance.

        GitHub identifies contributors by author email address. This endpoint groups contribution counts by GitHub user, which includes all associated email addresses. To improve performance, only the first 500 author email addresses in the repository link to GitHub users. The rest will appear as anonymous contributors without associated GitHub user information.

      summary: Create a deployment
      description: |-
        Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.

        The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
        before we merge a pull request.

        The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
        multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
        makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.

        The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
        the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
        the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
        return a failure response.

        By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/commits#commit-statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
        state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
        specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
        not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

        The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
        field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

        The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
        be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
        application with debugging enabled.

        Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.

        #### Merged branch response
        You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
        a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
        *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
        *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
        *   There are no merge conflicts

        If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
        response.

        #### Merge conflict response
        This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
        be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.

        #### Failed commit status checks
        This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
        status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

      summary: Delete a deployment
      description: |-
        If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment regardless of its status. If the repository has more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete a deployment.

        To set a deployment as inactive, you must:

        *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
        *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.

      summary: Create a repository dispatch event
      description: |-
        You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."

        The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.

        This endpoint requires write access to the repository by providing either:

          - Personal access tokens with `repo` scope. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)" in the GitHub Help documentation.
          - GitHub Apps with both `metadata:read` and `contents:read&write` permissions.

        This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.

      summary: Request a GitHub Pages build
      description: |-
        You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.

        Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first completes.

      summary: Upload a release asset
      description: |-
        This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
        the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.

        You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.

        Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example: 

        `application/zip`

        GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
        you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.

        When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.

        **Notes:**
        *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List assets for a release](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#list-assets-for-a-release)"
        endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
        *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

The authenticated user must own or be a member of an organization that owns the repository. To check if a repository is available to use as a template, get the repository's information using the [Get a repository](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#get-a-repository) endpoint and check that the `is_template` key is `true`.

        **OAuth scope requirements**

        When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:

        *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
        *   `repo` scope to create a private repository

        **OAuth scope requirements**

        When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:

        *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
        *   `repo` scope to create a private repository.

            # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

            ## Our Pledge

            In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

            ## Our Standards

            Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

            * Using welcoming and inclusive language
            * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
            * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
            * Focusing on what is best for the community
            * Showing empathy towards other community members

            Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

            * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
            * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
            * Public or private harassment
            * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
            * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

            ## Our Responsibilities

            Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
                              to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

            Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

            ## Scope

            This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
                              posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

            ## Enforcement

            Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

            Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

            ## Attribution
